# Getting Started in Programming

## Intro (short description, 10 min tops)

* WHAT: This talk will be about going from absolute beginner to professional programmer.
* HOW: Walk everybody through the life of a Do-it-Yourself programmer from the very beginning to an established career.

* Is school useful?
  * Maybe, but this is a guide for doing it yourself with nothing except a basic computer and an internet connection.

## Absolute Beginner

* Do we remember being an absolute beginner? What was it like?
  * All code looks like gibberish to someone unfamiliar with the syntax. Even experts look at unfamiliar syntaxes and see gibberish at first.
* Your job is to learn what the fundamental building blocks of most languages are:
  * Variables
  * Blocks
  * Looping
  * If / Else
* Starting with Scratch
  * First appeared in 2002 (14 years ago)
  * Developed at MIT Media Lab.
  * Name comes from "scratching" in computer science, which means to reuse code that can be beneficial and effectively used for other purposes and easily combined, shared and adapted to new scenarios.

## Beginner

* Now you know some basics of programming like variables, loops and if/else statements.
* Now it's time to choose a first written programming language
* You can't choose a language based upon what you want to do, if you don't know what you want to do, yet.
* How to choose a first programming language
  * Let us choose for you: go with javascript.
  * Ubiquitous, Easy-to-learn, Versatile, Massive Community Support, IoT, Lots of Good Libraries
  * Lots of jobs that will probably still be around when you're ready.
* Your job as a beginner is to learn the fundamental building blocks of most written programming languages:
  * String
  * Number
  * Function
  * Array
  * Hash
  * Looping
  * If/Else
  * Switch
  * Class / Struct
    * Static
    * Instance
    * Protected / Private
* Learning The Basics
  * Guided Learning:
    * Javascript: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript
  * Books:
    * Coding with Javascript For Dummies: https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/coding-with-javascript-for-dummies
  * YouTube:
    * Watch out for out-of-date videos
  * Paid Video Sites:
    * Lynda.com
* Choosing a First Project
  * Hello World is an exersize, not a project.
  * Quote Manager
    * Add quotes to a text file
    * read a random quote from the text file
* Version Control
  * Making changes in the future could mess this code up.
  * Version control can give us a "save point" that we can go back to.

## Intermediate

* You know how to code something for yourself.
* Now it's time to use other peoples' code.
* Best Practices
  * DRY vs. WET
  * Documentation / Commenting vs. Code Smell
  * Small files
  * Linting
  * Tabs vs Spaces: It doesn't matter. Pick something and stick to it.
  * Editor: Nobody cares what editor you use, as long as you can write good code in it.
    * Notepad works, but it's too basic for professional programming where speed and accuracy is important.
* Finding libraries
  * Search engine (starting point): "<programming language name> <primary functionality you're looking for>"
  * Blogs that compare libraries for you. (Beware of blogs that seem to favor one approach strongly over the others.)
  * Email Newsletters: http://javascriptweekly.com/, http://nodeweekly.com/
* How to Know Which Libraries Are Best
  * Number of stars on github
  * Activity report on github
  * Does the API look good?
  * Is it tested?
* Documentation
  * How to find it and use it.
  * How to write it properly.
    * What is a hand-off?
    * Why is a graceful hand-off important?
* Debugging
  * Figuring out what went wrong
  * Reading errors
  * Stack traces
  * Types of Errors
    * Syntax Error
    * Semantic Error
    * Logic Error
  * Asking for Help: Where and How
    * How to ask for help the wrong way
      * Explanation of the problem should be in the comments of the code that isn't working!
      * This way there's a single URL that can be passed around for others to quickly understand the problem and how to help.
    * Issue Trackers
    * Public Forums / Chat Rooms
* Test-Driven Development
  * It's almost always the "right way" of writing software.
    * https://www.infoq.com/news/2009/03/TDD-Improves-Quality
  * There are more scenarios where testing makes sense than not.
    * If you plan on maintaining your software after the first version, TDD makes sense.
    * If your problem domain is very complex, TDD makes sense.
    * If your software is expected to grow large, TDD makes sense.
    * If you don't have a lot of resources to throw at Q&A, TDD makes sense.
    * If you want to continuously integrate new features into your software, TDD is MANDATORY.
    * If you don't want to die early from a horrible stress-related ailment, TDD makes a lot of sense.
  * If you're builkding a prototype which is not expected to be used in production, TDD probably doesn't make sense.
* Re-Writing The Quote Manager in TDD
  * Searching "How to test in <programming language>"
  * start over with TDD
  * find a quote by word search
  * get quote of the day from website

## First Job

* Skills all professional programmers must know
  * Version Control
  * Shell / Terminal
  * How to Find & Read Documentation
  * Familiarity with which libraries / frameworks are most popular for the language.
  * Language idioms (don't write ruby code like javascript, etc.)
  * When to ask for help
  * How to write clean, well-structured code.
  * How to write obvious code that future developers can understand & extend easily.
* Soft skills all professional programmers must know
  * Make sure you can give and recieve constructive criticism
  * Know the basics of a code review, most large companies use them
    * One or Two other people will look over your code.
  * know version control, understand merging and pull requests
  * Praise others in public, Criticize them in Private
  * Under-promise, Over-deliver
* Optional skills that most employers will want
  * Attend meetups and be active in the community, onlien and locally
  * Do small projects on Github, recruiters will check that
    * Always have a project available that is a good representation of your current "best work".
    * Update or create a new project if the old one seems stale.
* Knowing when you're ready to apply for a programming job
  * You have several completed projects under your belt that are ready to show off.
  * Your friends/family come to you asking for your work. This is a good indicator that you have a marketable set of skills.
  * You look at professional work and think, "I could do that." or "I could do that better."
  * You've wondered if you're ready to apply for a programming job for a long time. (years)
* Taking a chance, even when you're unsure
  * The worst that can happen is nobody contacts you back, which isn't really a bad thing anyways.
  * There's a huge list of companies out there. Every company that doesn't call you back takes another name off that list and gets you closer to knowing your real best opportunities.

## So, Now You're a Professional

* Continued Education
* Staying Involved / Knowing What's Going On
* Teach Others
* Donate Skills

# Summary (10 minutes or less)

## Amateur

* Choose a high level language and move down the stack as necessary
* Learn the basics of programming
* Pick a manageable but personally interesting project
* *Try things!* Remember the mindset of a young child. Try everything, just to see what happens.
* It's pretty hard to break a (non-windows) computer.
* Programming is the art of debugging an empty file (helpful mindset)

## Professional

* Companies will require a certain base set of skills. You'll need to learn them.
* You'll need to learn how to be a "team player", which requires learning certain "soft skills".
* Communication is key. Ask questions. Lots of questions.
* Doing things quickly is more important than doing them in a clever way.
* Doing things quickly is *NOT* more important than doing them correctly.
* Keep up on best practices throughout your entire career.
* Learn how to write effective documentation for hand-offs.
