## Introduction

* Where did programming come from?

* Why do we call it programming?
* Who invented the first programming language?
* What did the early programming languages run on?
* What did early programming languages solve?
* When did programming become modern?
* Do we use any tech from early programming?

## The invention of programming

### Ada Lovelace

* known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine
* Ada was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.[10] In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite being ill Ada developed her mathematical and technological skills.


## Simple Devices

### Tally Stick

### Abacus

* The period 2700â€“2300 BC (7300-7700 HE) saw the first appearance of the Sumerian abacus.
* It was a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude.
* They used a sexagesimal number system.

## Mechanical Devices

### Antikythera mechanism

* The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer.
* It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
* It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete.
* It has been dated to circa 100 BC (9900 HE).
