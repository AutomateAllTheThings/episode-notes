## Past

### Number Systems

### Calendars

#### Holocene

* The Holocene calendar, also known as the Holocene Era (HE) is a year numbering system that adds exactly 10,000 years to the currently world-dominant AD or CE era system.
* This places its first year near the beginning of the Holocene epoch and the Neolithic revolution, making the current year 12,016 HE.
* It was first proposed by the scientist Cesare Emiliani in 1993.

### Early Computers

#### Abacus

* The period 2700â€“2300 BC (7300-7700 HE) saw the first appearance of the Sumerian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system.
*

#### Antikythera mechanism

* The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer.
* It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
* It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete.
