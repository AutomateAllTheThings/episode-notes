# AutomateAllTheThings Episode Notes

Welcome! We use these notes to help organize episode ideas. Everybody is free to read them in case they're interesting or informative.

## How This Repo Works

1. Guests on the show are given write access to this repository.
2. Guests can submit episode ideas, & help work on in-progress ideas.
3. Development is handled on the `develop` branch.
3. Finals are published to the `master` branch.

## Versioning System

* Episode versioning is handled similarly to `semver`: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` --> `FORMAT.TOPIC.EPISODE`
    * `FORMAT` versions represent a `show format`.
    * `TOPIC` versions represent a `show topic`.
    * `EPISODE` versions represent `episode numbers`.
* Versions `0.x.x` represent episodes made before an official `show format` is finalized.
* Versions `1.x.x` and beyond represent episodes made according to an official `show format`.

**Examples:**

* `0.1.1` is the first episode about the first topic discussed before a show format is finalized.
* `1.1.1` will be the first episode about the first topic discussed after a show format is finalized.
* `2.3.4` will be the fourth episode about the third topic discussed in the show's second format.
